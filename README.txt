A short python script to validate if a ISBN 
(International Standard Book Number)
 is True or False.

This is for Reddit daily programmer challenge 197:Easy

ISBN_validator is a standalone validator.

ISBN_func is a function that will return True or False 
on a string.

This is my first real project on GitHub, and one of my 
first pieces of work as a novice programmer.
